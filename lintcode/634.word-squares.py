#  Note: -

#  Given a set of words **without duplicates**, find all [`word squares`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_square "Word square") you can build from them.
#  
#  A sequence of words forms a valid word square if the kth row and column read the exact same string, where 0 â‰¤ k < max(numRows, numColumns).
#  
#  For example, the word sequence `["ball","area","lead","lady"]` forms a word square because each word reads the same both horizontally and vertically.
#  ```
#  b a l l
#  a r e a
#  l e a d
#  l a d y
#  ```
#  
#  **Example 1:**
#  ```
#  Input:
#  ["area","lead","wall","lady","ball"]
#  Output:
#  [["wall","area","lead","lady"],["ball","area","lead","lady"]]
#  
#  Explanation:
#  The output consists of two word squares. The order of output does not matter (just the order of words in each word square matters).
#  ```
#  
#  **Example 2:**
#  ```
#  Input:
#  ["abat","baba","atan","atal"]
#  Output:
#   [["baba","abat","baba","atan"],["baba","abat","baba","atal"]]
#  ```
#  
#  - There are at least 1 and at most 1000 words.
#  - All words will have the exact same length.
#  - Word length is at least 1 and at most 5.
#  - Each word contains only lowercase English alphabet `a-z`.
