#  You are given an array of integers nums. You are also given an integer original which is the first number that needs to be searched for in nums.
#  You then do the following steps:
#  
#  If original is found in nums, multiply it by two (i.e., set original = 2 * original).
#  Otherwise, stop the process.
#  Repeat this process with the new number as long as you keep finding the number.
#  
#  Return the final value of original.
#   
#  Example 1:
#  
#  Input: nums = [5,3,6,1,12], original = 3
#  Output: 24
#  Explanation: 
#  - 3 is found in nums. 3 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 6.
#  - 6 is found in nums. 6 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 12.
#  - 12 is found in nums. 12 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 24.
#  - 24 is not found in nums. Thus, 24 is returned.
#  
#  Example 2:
#  
#  Input: nums = [2,7,9], original = 4
#  Output: 4
#  Explanation:
#  - 4 is not found in nums. Thus, 4 is returned.
#  
#   
#  Constraints:
#  
#  1 <= nums.length <= 1000
#  1 <= nums[i], original <= 1000
#

class Solution:
    def findFinalValue(self, nums: List[int], original: int) -> int:
        nums = set(nums)
        res = original
        while res in nums:
            res *= 2

        return res
