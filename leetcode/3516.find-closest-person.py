#  You are given three integers x, y, and z, representing the positions of three people on a number line:
#  
#  x is the position of Person 1.
#  y is the position of Person 2.
#  z is the position of Person 3, who does not move.
#  
#  Both Person 1 and Person 2 move toward Person 3 at the same speed.
#  Determine which person reaches Person 3 first:
#  
#  Return 1 if Person 1 arrives first.
#  Return 2 if Person 2 arrives first.
#  Return 0 if both arrive at the same time.
#  
#  Return the result accordingly.
#   
#  Example 1:
#  
#  Input: x = 2, y = 7, z = 4
#  Output: 1
#  Explanation:
#  
#  Person 1 is at position 2 and can reach Person 3 (at position 4) in 2 steps.
#  Person 2 is at position 7 and can reach Person 3 in 3 steps.
#  
#  Since Person 1 reaches Person 3 first, the output is 1.
#  
#  Example 2:
#  
#  Input: x = 2, y = 5, z = 6
#  Output: 2
#  Explanation:
#  
#  Person 1 is at position 2 and can reach Person 3 (at position 6) in 4 steps.
#  Person 2 is at position 5 and can reach Person 3 in 1 step.
#  
#  Since Person 2 reaches Person 3 first, the output is 2.
#  
#  Example 3:
#  
#  Input: x = 1, y = 5, z = 3
#  Output: 0
#  Explanation:
#  
#  Person 1 is at position 1 and can reach Person 3 (at position 3) in 2 steps.
#  Person 2 is at position 5 and can reach Person 3 in 2 steps.
#  
#  Since both Person 1 and Person 2 reach Person 3 at the same time, the output is 0.
#  
#   
#  Constraints:
#  
#  1 <= x, y, z <= 100
#  
#

        else:
            return 2 if abs(x - z) > abs(y - z) else 1
