#  Seven different symbols represent Roman numerals with the following values:
#  
#  
#  
#  Symbol
#  Value
#  
#  
#  
#  
#  I
#  1
#  
#  
#  V
#  5
#  
#  
#  X
#  10
#  
#  
#  L
#  50
#  
#  
#  C
#  100
#  
#  
#  D
#  500
#  
#  
#  M
#  1000
#  
#  
#  
#  Roman numerals are formed by appending the conversions of decimal place values from highest to lowest. Converting a decimal place value into a Roman numeral has the following rules:
#  
#  If the value does not start with 4 or 9, select the symbol of the maximal value that can be subtracted from the input, append that symbol to the result, subtract its value, and convert the remainder to a Roman numeral.
#  If the value starts with 4 or 9 use the subtractive form representing one symbol subtracted from the following symbol, for example, 4 is 1 (I) less than 5 (V): IV and 9 is 1 (I) less than 10 (X): IX. Only the following subtractive forms are used: 4 (IV), 9 (IX), 40 (XL), 90 (XC), 400 (CD) and 900 (CM).
#  Only powers of 10 (I, X, C, M) can be appended consecutively at most 3 times to represent multiples of 10. You cannot append 5 (V), 50 (L), or 500 (D) multiple times. If you need to append a symbol 4 times use the subtractive form.
#  
#  Given an integer, convert it to a Roman numeral.
#   
#  Example 1:
#  
#  Input: num = 3749
#  Output: "MMMDCCXLIX"
#  Explanation:
#  
#  3000 = MMM as 1000 (M) + 1000 (M) + 1000 (M)
#   700 = DCC as 500 (D) + 100 (C) + 100 (C)
#    40 = XL as 10 (X) less of 50 (L)
#     9 = IX as 1 (I) less of 10 (X)
#  Note: 49 is not 1 (I) less of 50 (L) because the conversion is based on decimal places
#  
#  
#  Example 2:
#  
#  Input: num = 58
#  Output: "LVIII"
#  Explanation:
#  
#  50 = L
#   8 = VIII
#  
#  
#  Example 3:
#  
#  Input: num = 1994
#  Output: "MCMXCIV"
#  Explanation:
#  
#  1000 = M
#   900 = CM
#    90 = XC
#     4 = IV
#  
#  
#   
#  Constraints:
#  
#  1 <= num <= 3999
#  
#
