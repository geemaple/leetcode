#  You are given a string num consisting of only digits. A string of digits is called balanced if the sum of the digits at even indices is equal to the sum of digits at odd indices.
#  Return true if num is balanced, otherwise return false.
#   
#  Example 1:
#  
#  Input: num = "1234"
#  Output: false
#  Explanation:
#  
#  The sum of digits at even indices is 1 + 3 == 4, and the sum of digits at odd indices is 2 + 4 == 6.
#  Since 4 is not equal to 6, num is not balanced.
#  
#  
#  Example 2:
#  
#  Input: num = "24123"
#  Output: true
#  Explanation:
#  
#  The sum of digits at even indices is 2 + 1 + 3 == 6, and the sum of digits at odd indices is 4 + 2 == 6.
#  Since both are equal the num is balanced.
#  
#  
#   
#  Constraints:
#  
#  2 <= num.length <= 100
#  num consists of digits only
#  
#
