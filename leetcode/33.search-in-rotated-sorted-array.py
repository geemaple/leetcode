#  Note: Rotated ðŸŸ¢

#  There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).
#  Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].
#  Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.
#  You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
#  Â 
#  Example 1:
#  Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
#  Output: 4
#  Example 2:
#  Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
#  Output: -1
#  Example 3:
#  Input: nums = [1], target = 0
#  Output: -1
#  
#  Â 
#  Constraints:
#  
#  1 <= nums.length <= 5000
#  -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
#  All values of nums are unique.
#  nums is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
#  -104 <= target <= 104
