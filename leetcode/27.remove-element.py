#  Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.
#  Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:
#  
#  Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
#  Return k.
#  
#  Custom Judge:
#  The judge will test your solution with the following code:
#  
#  int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
#  int val = ...; // Value to remove
#  int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length.
#                              // It is sorted with no values equaling val.
#  
#  int k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation
#  
#  assert k == expectedNums.length;
#  sort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of nums
#  for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {
#      assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
#  }
#  
#  If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.
#   
#  Example 1:
#  
#  Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
#  Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
#  Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
#  It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
#  
#  Example 2:
#  
#  Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
#  Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
#  Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
#  Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
#  It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
#  
#   
#  Constraints:
#  
#  0 <= nums.length <= 100
#  0 <= nums[i] <= 50
#  0 <= val <= 100
#  
#
