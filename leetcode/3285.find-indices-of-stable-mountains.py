#  There are n mountains in a row, and each mountain has a height. You are given an integer array height where height[i] represents the height of mountain i, and an integer threshold.
#  A mountain is called stable if the mountain just before it (if it exists) has a height strictly greater than threshold. Note that mountain 0 is not stable.
#  Return an array containing the indices of all stable mountains in any order.
#   
#  Example 1:
#  
#  Input: height = [1,2,3,4,5], threshold = 2
#  Output: [3,4]
#  Explanation:
#  
#  Mountain 3 is stable because height[2] == 3 is greater than threshold == 2.
#  Mountain 4 is stable because height[3] == 4 is greater than threshold == 2.
#  
#  
#  Example 2:
#  
#  Input: height = [10,1,10,1,10], threshold = 3
#  Output: [1,3]
#  
#  Example 3:
#  
#  Input: height = [10,1,10,1,10], threshold = 10
#  Output: []
#  
#   
#  Constraints:
#  
#  2 <= n == height.length <= 100
#  1 <= height[i] <= 100
#  1 <= threshold <= 100
#  
#
