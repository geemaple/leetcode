#  We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
#  I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
#  Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.
#  You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:
#  
#  -1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
#  1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
#  0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).
#  
#  Return the number that I picked.
#  Â 
#  Example 1:
#  
#  Input: n = 10, pick = 6
#  Output: 6
#  
#  Example 2:
#  
#  Input: n = 1, pick = 1
#  Output: 1
#  
#  Example 3:
#  
#  Input: n = 2, pick = 1
#  Output: 1
#  
#  Â 
#  Constraints:
#  
#  1 <= n <= 231 - 1
#  1 <= pick <= n
#  
#  

# The guess API is already defined for you.
# @param num, your guess
# @return -1 if num is higher than the picked number
#          1 if num is lower than the picked number
#          otherwise return 0
# def guess(num):
