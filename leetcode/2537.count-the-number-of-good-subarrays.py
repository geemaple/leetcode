#  Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the number of good subarrays of nums.
#  A subarray arr is good if there are at least k pairs of indices (i, j) such that i < j and arr[i] == arr[j].
#  A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
#  Â 
#  Example 1:
#  
#  Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1], k = 10
#  Output: 1
#  Explanation: The only good subarray is the array nums itself.
#  
#  Example 2:
#  
#  Input: nums = [3,1,4,3,2,2,4], k = 2
#  Output: 4
#  Explanation: There are 4 different good subarrays:
#  - [3,1,4,3,2,2] that has 2 pairs.
#  - [3,1,4,3,2,2,4] that has 3 pairs.
#  - [1,4,3,2,2,4] that has 2 pairs.
#  - [4,3,2,2,4] that has 2 pairs.
#  
#  Â 
#  Constraints:
#  
#  1 <= nums.length <= 105
#  1 <= nums[i], k <= 109
#  
#
