#  There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i].
#  You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
#  Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
#   
#  Example 1:
#  
#  Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
#  Output: 3
#  Explanation:
#  Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
#  Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
#  Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
#  Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
#  Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
#  Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
#  Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
#  
#  Example 2:
#  
#  Input: gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]
#  Output: -1
#  Explanation:
#  You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
#  Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
#  Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
#  Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
#  You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
#  Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.
#  
#   
#  Constraints:
#  
#  n == gas.length == cost.length
#  1 <= n <= 105
#  0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 104
#  
#
