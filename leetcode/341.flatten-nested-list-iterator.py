#  You are given a nested list of integers nestedList. Each element is either an integer or a list whose elements may also be integers or other lists. Implement an iterator to flatten it.
#  Implement the NestedIterator class:
#  
#  NestedIterator(List<NestedInteger> nestedList) Initializes the iterator with the nested list nestedList.
#  int next() Returns the next integer in the nested list.
#  boolean hasNext() Returns true if there are still some integers in the nested list and false otherwise.
#  
#  Your code will be tested with the following pseudocode:
#  
#  initialize iterator with nestedList
#  res = []
#  while iterator.hasNext()
#      append iterator.next() to the end of res
#  return res
#  
#  If res matches the expected flattened list, then your code will be judged as correct.
#   
#  Example 1:
#  
#  Input: nestedList = [[1,1],2,[1,1]]
#  Output: [1,1,2,1,1]
#  Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,1,2,1,1].
#  
#  Example 2:
#  
#  Input: nestedList = [1,[4,[6]]]
#  Output: [1,4,6]
#  Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,4,6].
#  
#   
#  Constraints:
#  
#  1 <= nestedList.length <= 500
#  The values of the integers in the nested list is in the range [-106, 106].
#  
#
