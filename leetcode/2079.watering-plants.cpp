//  You want to water n plants in your garden with a watering can. The plants are arranged in a row and are labeled from 0 to n - 1 from left to right where the ith plant is located at x = i. There is a river at x = -1 that you can refill your watering can at.
//  Each plant needs a specific amount of water. You will water the plants in the following way:
//  
//  Water the plants in order from left to right.
//  After watering the current plant, if you do not have enough water to completely water the next plant, return to the river to fully refill the watering can.
//  You cannot refill the watering can early.
//  
//  You are initially at the river (i.e., x = -1). It takes one step to move one unit on the x-axis.
//  Given a 0-indexed integer array plants of n integers, where plants[i] is the amount of water the ith plant needs, and an integer capacity representing the watering can capacity, return the number of steps needed to water all the plants.
//   
//  Example 1:
//  
//  Input: plants = [2,2,3,3], capacity = 5
//  Output: 14
//  Explanation: Start at the river with a full watering can:
//  - Walk to plant 0 (1 step) and water it. Watering can has 3 units of water.
//  - Walk to plant 1 (1 step) and water it. Watering can has 1 unit of water.
//  - Since you cannot completely water plant 2, walk back to the river to refill (2 steps).
//  - Walk to plant 2 (3 steps) and water it. Watering can has 2 units of water.
//  - Since you cannot completely water plant 3, walk back to the river to refill (3 steps).
//  - Walk to plant 3 (4 steps) and water it.
//  Steps needed = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 14.
//  
//  Example 2:
//  
//  Input: plants = [1,1,1,4,2,3], capacity = 4
//  Output: 30
//  Explanation: Start at the river with a full watering can:
//  - Water plants 0, 1, and 2 (3 steps). Return to river (3 steps).
//  - Water plant 3 (4 steps). Return to river (4 steps).
//  - Water plant 4 (5 steps). Return to river (5 steps).
//  - Water plant 5 (6 steps).
//  Steps needed = 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 6 = 30.
//  
//  Example 3:
//  
//  Input: plants = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7], capacity = 8
//  Output: 49
//  Explanation: You have to refill before watering each plant.
//  Steps needed = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 6 + 6 + 7 = 49.
//  
//   
//  Constraints:
//  
//  n == plants.length
//  1 <= n <= 1000
//  1 <= plants[i] <= 106
//  max(plants[i]) <= capacity <= 109
//  
//
