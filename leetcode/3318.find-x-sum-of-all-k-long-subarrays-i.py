#  You are given an array nums of n integers and two integers k and x.
#  The x-sum of an array is calculated by the following procedure:
#  
#  Count the occurrences of all elements in the array.
#  Keep only the occurrences of the top x most frequent elements. If two elements have the same number of occurrences, the element with the bigger value is considered more frequent.
#  Calculate the sum of the resulting array.
#  
#  Note that if an array has less than x distinct elements, its x-sum is the sum of the array.
#  Return an integer array answer of length n - k + 1 where answer[i] is the x-sum of the subarray nums[i..i + k - 1].
#   
#  Example 1:
#  
#  Input: nums = [1,1,2,2,3,4,2,3], k = 6, x = 2
#  Output: [6,10,12]
#  Explanation:
#  
#  For subarray [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4], only elements 1 and 2 will be kept in the resulting array. Hence, answer[0] = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2.
#  For subarray [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2], only elements 2 and 4 will be kept in the resulting array. Hence, answer[1] = 2 + 2 + 2 + 4. Note that 4 is kept in the array since it is bigger than 3 and 1 which occur the same number of times.
#  For subarray [2, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3], only elements 2 and 3 are kept in the resulting array. Hence, answer[2] = 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3.
#  
#  
#  Example 2:
#  
#  Input: nums = [3,8,7,8,7,5], k = 2, x = 2
#  Output: [11,15,15,15,12]
#  Explanation:
#  Since k == x, answer[i] is equal to the sum of the subarray nums[i..i + k - 1].
#  
#   
#  Constraints:
#  
#  1 <= n == nums.length <= 50
#  1 <= nums[i] <= 50
#  1 <= x <= k <= nums.length
#  
#
